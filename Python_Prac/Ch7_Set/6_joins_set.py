#Using the "|" Operator
"""
The "|" symbol (pipe) is defined as the union operator. It performs the AâˆªB operation and returns a set of items in A, B or both. 
Set doesn't allow duplicate items."""

#Using the union() Method
"""
The set class has union() method that performs the same operation as | operator. It returns a set object that holds all items in both sets, discarding duplicates."""

#Using the update() Method
"""The update() method also joins the two sets, as the union() method. 
However it doen't return a new set object. 
Instead, the elements of second set are added in first, 
duplicates not allowed."""

#Using the unpacking Operator
"""the "*" symbol is used as unpacking operator. The unpacking operator internally assign each element in a collection to a separate variable."""
