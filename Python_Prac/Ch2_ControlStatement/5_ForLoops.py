#Using "for" with a String

A string is a sequence of Unicode letters, 
each having a positional index. The following 
example compares each character and displays 
if it is not a vowel ('a', 'e', 'I', 'o' or 'u')"""

# Using "for" with a Tuple

Python's tuple object is also an indexed sequence,

Example
In the following example, the for loop traverses 
a tuple containing integers and returns the total of all numbers."""

#Using "for" with a Range Object
"""
Python's buil-in range() function returns a range object.

Unlike a list, tuple or a string, dictionary data type in Python is not a sequence, as the items do not have a positional index. However, 
traversing a dictionary is still possible with different techniques.
