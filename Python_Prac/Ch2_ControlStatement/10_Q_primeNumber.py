"""he algorithm for finding prime factors is as follows âˆ’

Accept input from user (n)

Set divisor (d) to 2

Perform following till n>1

Check if given number (n) is divisible by divisor (d).

If n%d==0

a. Print d as a factor

Set new value of n as n/d

Repeat from 4

If not

Increment d by 1

Repeat from 3
