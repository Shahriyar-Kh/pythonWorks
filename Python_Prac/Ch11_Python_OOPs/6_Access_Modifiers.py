"""
Python doesn't enforce restrictions on accessing any instance variable or method. 
However, Python prescribes a convention of prefixing name of variable/method with 
single or double underscore to emulate behavior of protected and private access modifiers.

To indicate that an instance variable is private, prefix it with double underscore (such as "__age"). 
To imply that a certain instance variable is protected, prefix it with single underscore (such as "_salary")
        """


"""
Let us modify the Employee class. Add another instance variable salary. 
Make age private and salary as protected by prefixing double and single underscores respectively.

# 6.1 Name Mangling
"""
Python doesn't block access to private data, it just leaves for the wisdom of the programmer,
not to write any code that access it from outside the class. 
You can still access the private members by Python's name mangling technique.

Name mangling is the process of changing name of a member with double underscore to the form object._class__variable. 
If so required, it can still be accessed from outside the class, 
but the practice should be refrained.
